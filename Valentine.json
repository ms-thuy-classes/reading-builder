      "text": "Valentine’s Day is celebrated on February 14 each year with chocolates, flowers, and brightly colored cards featuring hearts, Cupids, and expressions of love. Although traditionally celebrated as a reflection of romantic love, the holiday has evolved into a more general celebration of friendship and appreciation, one shared with family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. The holiday is even now celebrated by buying gifts for our pets and for ourselves, indulging in self-gifting as a way to prioritize personal well-being.",

      "text": "St. Valentine was the name of legendary Christian martyrs killed during the persecution of Christians by Roman emperor Claudius II Gothicus about 270 ce. One account explains that Valentine was condemned to death for defying the emperor by secretly marrying couples to spare the husbands from conscription and war. While in prison, he allegedly befriended his jailer’s daughter and wrote her a farewell message signed 'from your Valentine.'",

      "heading": "The Rise of Romantic Love",
      "text": "It took another thousand years before the day became associated with romance. Many scholars credit Geoffrey Chaucer’s 1380 poem 'The Parlement of Foules' for connecting the feast day with love, describing it as the time when birds choose their mates. By the 1840s, the British 'Penny Post' made sending anonymous cards affordable, and Esther Howland, the 'mother of the American valentine,' began mass-producing elaborate laced cards in the US.",

      "heading": "The Debate: Should We Still Celebrate?",
      "text": "The holiday faces intense debate. PROS: It provides a special opportunity to celebrate partners, boosts the economy for small businesses like florists and restaurants, and offers a fun day for self-care. CONS: Critics argue love should be an everyday practice, the day has become overly commercialized and expensive, and its original romantic meaning has been diluted by celebrating everyone including pets.",
